# DnD-5e-Spell-Index
A minor windows form application that retrieves a searched spell out of a database and displays it to the user.

UPDATE: May 23rd 2018

  -Database Progress:
I have not worked on the Database code since the last update. However, I do plan on including a way to add spells to the database, as well as modify the database connection information in the future.

  -Search Filtering:
I have succesfully implemented filtering by School and by Level. The application works with either one selected or both selected. I have included a reset button that deselects the filters. The filtered spell list can be viewed by clicking on the down arrow of the search bar. I plan to list the filtered spells in a better, more user friendly way in the future. 

  -User Interface:
I plan on updating the user interface in the future. Right now it is a really rough windows form app and I hope to eventually reach a graphical application. I am not going to lie, that will be a very big hurdle to get over in the future. So it is something that is planned but will probably not see any implementation soon.

UPDATE: May 8th 2018

  -Database Progress:
I have completed integration of the Database system. The application can now search the included Database assuming the Database is hosted and the code is modified to include the updated connection information. 

  -Commenting:
Pretty much every update from now on should also include updated comments that are relatively easy to understand so I am going to stop talking about them in my updates.

  -Search Filtering:
I have deactivated the search filtering by commenting out the broken implementation. Plan on fixing it in future updates, but again the app should work without them for now.

UPDATE: May 7th 2018

  -Database Progress:
I have uploaded the text out of the Text Doc containing the spell information into a Database that is now included in the files. I have been hosting/testing it locally on my laptop and as of now do not plan on giving it any dedicated server as this is just a fun project. The Database code is not finished so as it stands right now the application still runs off of the original Text Doc.

  -Commenting:
I have been getting better about commenting along the way so hopefully it is easier to understand what is going on.

  -Search Filtering:
The search bar filter I have been attempting to implement has proved to be more difficult than I originally thought. There is currently a broken half-attempt at implementation that does not work but you still should be able to search without the filters no problem. 

  I have not taken any time to add the rest of the spells from the Dungeons & Dragons materials. I probably won't be doing that until I have the database up and working, that way I can add the spells through the application rather than the Text Doc.


As of April 4th 2018,
Current intentions are:
  -add comments and make code easier to read. 
  -switch from a text file to database. 
  -add the rest of the standard spells. 
  -enable user to filter search spells by casting class, utilization (I.E. combat damage, combat auxiliary, utility, etc.), components, casting time, range, school of magic, and others.
