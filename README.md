# DnD-5e-Spell-Index
A super minor windows form application that retrieves a searched spell out of a text file and displays it to the user.

As of April 4th 2018,
Current intentions are:
  -add comments and make code easier to read. 
  -switch from a text file to database. 
  -add the rest of the standard spells. 
  -enable user to filter search spells by casting class, utilization (I.E. combat damage, combat auxilary, utility, ect.), components, casting time, range, school of magic, and others.
