# DnD-5e-Spell-Index
A super minor windows form application that retrieves a searched spell out of a text file and displays it to the user.

UPDATE: May 7th 2018
  -Database Progress:
I have uploaded the text out of the Text Doc containing the spell information into a Database that is now included in the files. I have been hosting/testing it locally on my laptop and as of now do not plan on actually giving it any dedicated server as this is just a fun project. The Database code is not finished so as it stands right now the applicaiton still runs off of the original Text Doc.

  -Commenting:
I have been getting better about commenting along the way so hopefully it is easier to understand what is going on.

  -Search Filtering:
The search bar filter I have been attempting to implement has proved to be more difficult than I originally thought. There is currently a broken half-attempt at implimentation that does not work but you still should be able to search without the filters no problem. 

  I have not taken any time to add the rest of the spells from the Dungeons & Dragons materials. I probably won't be doing that until I have the database up and working, that way I can add the spells through the application rather than the Text Doc.

As of April 4th 2018,
Current intentions are:
  -add comments and make code easier to read. 
  -switch from a text file to database. 
  -add the rest of the standard spells. 
  -enable user to filter search spells by casting class, utilization (I.E. combat damage, combat auxilary, utility, ect.), components, casting time, range, school of magic, and others.
